# air_quality_prediction
In this project I have performed prediction of the air quality with the help of available data from Air quality dataset.
In this project we start with preprocessing the data.
We explore the data for better understanding.
Plotting the data for better understanding and prediction.
training the data for prediction.
Applying machine learning algorithms i.e. Linear regression.
Predicting the final output.
